## Session Changes - September 9, 2025

### üéØ Session Overview: New Landing Page Asset Management & Critical Fixes

This session focused on resolving critical asset path issues, cleaning up old landing references, and enhancing the new landing page with professional sports imagery.

---

## üìÅ Files Modified & Changes Made

### **1. `src/constants/app.js`**
**Purpose**: Remove old landing route reference

**Changes Made:**
```javascript
// REMOVED this line:
LANDING: '/landing',

// From the ROUTES object - cleaned up old landing route that no longer exists
export const ROUTES = {
  HOME: '/',
  LOGIN: '/login',  // (no more LANDING route)
  SIGNUP: '/signup',
  // ... rest of routes
};
```

**Impact**: Prevents references to deleted old landing directory

---

### **2. `src/contexts/AuthContext.js`**
**Purpose**: Update authenticated page check logic

**Changes Made:**
```javascript
// Line 147: UPDATED from:
const isAuthenticatedPage = !['/','', '/landing', '/login', '/signup'].includes(currentPath);

// To:
const isAuthenticatedPage = !['/','', '/login', '/signup'].includes(currentPath);
```

**Impact**: Removed `/landing` from authenticated page check since old landing was deleted

---

### **3. `src/utils/cssCleanup.js`**
**Purpose**: Remove old landing CSS classes from cleanup utility

**Changes Made:**
```javascript
// Lines 9-11: REMOVED these CSS classes:
'new-landing-page-loaded',
'landingpage3d-loaded', 
'landing-page-active',

// From bodyClassesToRemove array - these classes belonged to old landing system
```

**Impact**: Prevents CSS conflicts with deleted old landing classes

---

### **4. `src/pages/newlanding/main.css`**
**Purpose**: Fix webpack module resolution errors for background images

**Changes Made:**

**Line 3158:**
```css
/* CHANGED from: */
background-image: url('../../assets/images/landing/backgrounds/rectangle-133.png');

/* To: */
background-image: url('./images/bg.jpg');
```

**Line 3843:**
```css
/* CHANGED from: */
background-image: url('../../assets/images/landing/backgrounds/rectangle-135.png');

/* To: */
background-image: url('./images/stadium.jpg');
```

**Impact**: Fixed "Module not found" webpack errors by using relative paths to existing images

---

### **5. `src/pages/newlanding/NewLanding.js`**
**Purpose**: Fix broken image paths and update banner images

**Critical Fix - Line 313:**
```javascript
// FIXED incomplete image path:
// From: backgroundImage: `url('/src')`,
// To:   backgroundImage: `url('/newlanding/images/pic01.jpg')`,
```

**Banner Image Updates:**
```javascript
// Line 92: First Banner (Hero section with buttons)
// From: backgroundImage: `url('/newlanding/images/pic01.jpg')`
// To:   backgroundImage: `url('/newlanding/images/stadium.jpg')`

// Line 115: Second Banner ("Where Talent Meets Opportunity")  
// From: backgroundImage: `url('/newlanding/images/pic02.jpg')`
// To:   backgroundImage: `url('/newlanding/images/cycling.jpg')`

// Line 133: Third Banner ("Let's Conquer Together")
// From: backgroundImage: `url('/newlanding/images/pic03.jpg')`
// To:   backgroundImage: `url('/newlanding/images/action.jpg')`
```

**Route Fix - Line 107:**
```javascript
// FIXED broken app navigation:
// From: <Link to="/app" className="button alt">App</Link>
// To:   <Link to="/login" className="button alt">App</Link>
```

**Header Text Update - Line 72:**
```javascript
// Updated welcome text:
// From: <a href="#home">Hello <span>by AmaPlayer</span></a>
// To:   <a href="#home">Hello <span>from AmaPlayer</span></a>
```

**Impact**: Resolved critical build errors and enhanced visual appeal with professional sports imagery

---

### **6. `public/newlanding/images/` Directory**
**Purpose**: Copy all image assets to public directory for runtime access

**Changes Made:**
- Created `public/newlanding/images/` directory
- Copied all 23 image files (59MB total) from `src/pages/newlanding/images/`
- Key images include:
  - `stadium.jpg` - Modern stadium architecture (used in hero banner)
  - `cycling.jpg` - Professional cycling race (used in talent banner)  
  - `action.jpg` - Athletics steeplechase (used in motivation banner)
  - `athlete.jpg`, `coaches.jpg`, `organisation.jpg` - Role selection cards
  - `pic01.jpg`, `pic02.jpg`, `pic03.jpg` - Process flow illustrations

**Impact**: Enables proper image serving for React components using public paths

---

### **7. `public/newlanding/coaches.html`**
**Purpose**: Create missing HTML page to prevent 404 errors

**Changes Made:**
- Created complete HTML page with styled layout
- Professional gradient background and glassmorphism design
- Navigation buttons back to home and search
- Content about coaches discovery feature

**Impact**: Users can now click "View Coaches" without getting 404 error

---

### **8. `public/newlanding/organizations.html`**  
**Purpose**: Create missing HTML page to prevent 404 errors

**Changes Made:**
- Created complete HTML page with styled layout
- Different gradient theme from coaches page
- Navigation buttons back to home and events
- Content about organizations directory feature

**Impact**: Users can now click "View Organizations" without getting 404 error

---

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture Implemented

### **Dual Directory Asset Strategy**
```
claude-test/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/pages/newlanding/images/     # Source assets for CSS imports
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bg.jpg, stadium.jpg         # Used by main.css via relative paths
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [21 other sports images]    # Available for CSS development
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/newlanding/images/        # Runtime assets for JSX imports  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stadium.jpg, cycling.jpg    # Used by NewLanding.js via public paths
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ action.jpg, athlete.jpg     # Accessible at runtime via /newlanding/images/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [20 other copied images]    # Complete asset library
```

### **Path Resolution Strategy**
- **React JSX Components**: Use absolute public paths (`/newlanding/images/pic01.jpg`)
- **CSS Modules**: Use relative paths (`./images/bg.jpg`)
- **Reasoning**: Webpack handles these differently - JSX needs runtime access, CSS needs build-time resolution

## ‚úÖ Build & Development Status

### **Before Session (Broken State):**
- ‚ùå Webpack errors: "Module not found" for CSS background images
- ‚ùå React error: Incomplete image path `url('/src')`

- ‚ùå 404 errors: coaches.html and organizations.html missing
- ‚ùå Old landing references causing conflicts

### **After Session (Working State):**
